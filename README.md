 - in backend folder (cmd of bash):
         mvn spring-boot:run
 - in frontend folder (cmd of bash):
       · npm install 
       · ng serve

#2. EXECUTION
    - http://localhost:4200/tasks

#3. COMMENTS 
    - Tasks addition is working 
    - Tasks listing is working
    - With more time I would:
                · review care of SOLID principles in the backend, although in this version I have already added a service to get some layers.

                · improve error handling
