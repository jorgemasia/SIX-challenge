 - in backend folder (cmd of bash):
         -- mvn spring-boot:run
 - in frontend folder (cmd of bash):
       -- npm install   (needed if node modules are not in PATH because the node modules are not pushed in git repo)
       -- ng serve

#2. EXECUTION
    - http://localhost:4200/tasks

#3. COMMENTS 
    - Tasks addition is working 
    - Tasks listing is working
    - With more time I would:
                · review care of SOLID principles in the backend, although in this version I have already added a service to get some layers.

                · improve error handling
